# TryHackMe-Rooms
Welcome to my TryHackMe Journey repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress in network and cybersecurity through the TryHackMe platform. Here, I will be sharing links to the TryHackMe rooms I've completed, highlighting the hands-on skills and knowledge acquired from each room.

Overview
TryHackMe is an excellent platform that provides a variety of interactive cybersecurity training environments. Each room offers unique challenges and learning opportunities, allowing users to develop practical skills in real-world scenarios. This repository serves as both a personal archive of my learning journey and a resource for others interested in enhancing their cybersecurity capabilities.

Skills Acquired
Throughout this journey, I have gained numerous hands-on skills in various domains of cybersecurity, including but not limited to:

Network Scanning and Enumeration: Learning to use tools like Nmap to discover hosts, services, and vulnerabilities.
Web Application Security: Understanding common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and learning how to exploit and mitigate them.
Cryptography: Gaining insights into cryptographic algorithms, encryption/decryption methods, and practical applications of cryptography in securing communications.
Privilege Escalation: Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges on target systems.
Digital Forensics: Analyzing and investigating digital artifacts to uncover evidence and understand cyber incidents.
Penetration Testing: Conducting simulated attacks on networks and systems to assess their security posture and identify weaknesses.
Conclusion
This repository will be continuously updated as I progress through more TryHackMe rooms. Each entry aims to provide valuable insights and resources for those looking to develop their cybersecurity skills. Feel free to explore the links and join me on this exciting journey to mastering practical cybersecurity!

Happy Hacking!
